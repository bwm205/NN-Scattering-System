# Using Neural Networks to Image through Highly Scattering Media

Python code for imaging behind a simulated highly scattering medium using a neural network. The results of the investigation can be found in the accompanying report. The image bellow uses the network to construct a shaped input field for focusing on a target behind the medium. Both the field's amplitude and phase are shown.
